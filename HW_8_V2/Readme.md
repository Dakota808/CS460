This Lab was a mixture of understanding on how to build a database which has realtional and ajax compents.

Though, this is more of the diffcult party for me is to run the ajax onto the program that I have built.
Where as the database was not so. We are given four different tables for Artist Artwork and this part of the lab is to create those 
connections to make sure that we can take in the data we want and display them into the or data.

## Step 1: Make the SQL / Relational Database
Start by making a drawn out design of the realtional database and pointing out the data types of each table as well as the 
Primary Keys and Foreign Keys.
